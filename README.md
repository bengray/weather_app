This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Simple weather app put together for my own yucks.  It's pretty basic, using React and Redux 
to build a basic interface where a user can enter a city name and get some relevant data back from an API.

"npm start" gets it running on localhost:3000
